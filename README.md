# NLP Project

The objective of this project is twofold: we wish to retrieve a high amount of webpages whose domain is www.unipa.it by using web crawling techniques, then feed the obtained data to a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with the intent of building a system that behaves in a similar fashion to chatbots, starting from two pretrained LLMs: Zephyr-7B and LLaMA-3-8B. The system is then asked several questions regarding the University of Palermo, returning appropriate answers that can fit real-world scenarios. 


- `output`, containing output files generated by the crawler
- `src`, containing source files for the crawler
- `test`, containing the crawler's unit tests
- `rag_v2.ipynb`, containing the RAG's pipeline
- `IRNLP Project Report.pdf`, containing an in-depth description of the project
